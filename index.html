                <div class="box-content"><p>“You can’t sit around envying other people’s worlds. You have to go out and change your own.”<br>Being inspired by others is great, but at some point, you have to do something with that inspiration, or else the things you want will be ignored. And therefore you’ll make no progress.</p></div>

The one making your choices is yourself!”<br>No matter what happens, in the end, we’re the ones making the final decisions. Even if those decisions are hard, and even if those decisions are limited, it’s still our decision to make.</p></div>
